# Annoying Effects

[‰∏≠ÊñáREADME](README_zh.md)

A Minecraft mod that adds many status effects that are usually not lethal but will make players feel uncomfortable. This mod will be used in [Lantern-in-Storm](https://github.com/BaicaiBear/Lantern-in-Storm/) for negative effects in the `unstable` area.

All effects are not explicitly stated and need to be discovered by the players themselves.

‚úÖ = implemented for player

‚ú≥Ô∏è = implemented for mobs

‚ùáÔ∏è = can be amplified

‚úîÔ∏è = will not be implemented for mobs / be amplified
