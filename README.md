# Annoying Effects

[中文README](README_zh.md)

A Minecraft mod that adds many status effects that are usually not lethal but will make players feel uncomfortable. This mod will be used in [Lantern-in-Storm](https://github.com/BaicaiBear/Lantern-in-Storm/) for negative effects in the `unstable` area.

All effects are not explicitly stated and need to be discovered by the players themselves.
